# Choose backend language

## Status

DECIDED

## Context

Starting the project we need to decide about the language we will work with.
It is not clear if there will be a frontend. So we will only decide on the backend.

## Decision

We will use GOlang for the backend.
The main reason is that the main goal for the project is to apply some new technologies
and learn about them.

To ease the web api part we will use gin (https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). Reasons for
Gin is that it is simple and similar to Express.


## Consequences

We will find out.
